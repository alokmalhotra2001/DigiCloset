## Project Overview:
DigiCloset is a personalized clothing assistant app that makes mornings easier and digitizes your laundry pile. On this app, you can upload photos of your clothing, swipe through your closet to select from clean tops and bottoms, plan future outfits for the week, and find local donation centers to drop off unused clothing. The app will also be capable of recommending clothes to wear in the form of outfits. These outfits will be based on user preferences and weather data, with potential to integrate even more parameters into clothing recommendations.

### API technologies being used:
Weather API (to help with deciding daily outfits)
Maps API (for finding the closest donation center)
